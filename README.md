# Trans-Driver
# About
Trans-Driver, a deep supervised learning method, a multilayer perceptron converter network with an unbalanced loss function, which integrates multi-omics data to learn the differences and associations between different omics data for cancer driversâ€™ discovery. Compared with other state-of-the-art driver gene identification methods, Trans-Driver has achieved excellent performance on TCGA and CGC data sets. Among ~20,000 protein-coding genes, Trans-Driver reported 189 candidate driver genes, of which 105 genes (about 55%) were included in the gold standard CGC data set. Finally, we analyzed the contribution of each feature to the identification of driver genes. We found that the integration of multi-omics data can improve the performance of our method compared with using only somatic mutation data. Through detailed analysis, we found that the candidate drivers are clinically meaningful, proving the practicability of Trans-Driver.
